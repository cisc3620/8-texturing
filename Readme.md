# Lab 8: Bump mapping

## Starting point

The texture branch in this repository renders a rotating cube with each side textured with a picture of a bunny. The "bump" branch is the starting point for modifying the code to load normals from a separate texture. `git checkout bump` to see that code and instructions.
